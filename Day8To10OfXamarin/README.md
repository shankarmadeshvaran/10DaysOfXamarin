# 08th To 10th DayOfXamarin

## Work Completed in this Project
implemented the MVVM architectural pattern, we start by using the INotifyPropertyChanged interface in a way that helps us clean some of the code. 
This interface removes the necessity to get and set values to and from the XAML pages into C# objects. Instead, Data Binding does the work.
